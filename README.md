# Horiseon - Module 1 Challenge
Module 1 - Challenge

## Description 
This project was an on-the-job ticket from the Horiseon Marketing Agency.

The brief for this was to work on the codebase to ensure it followed current accessibility standards whilst being optimized for search engines.

The acceptance criteria for this were as follows:

* Semantic HTML elements to be added throughout the source code.
* HTML elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* CSS code to follow the same logical structure as the HTML with clear labelling for any future updates that need to be made.
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

## Installation

In order to do this work, a unique repository was created on GitHub with the original index.html and CSS files. This was then cloned to my local machine and then refactored using Visual Studio Code.

First steps were too work on the current code, refining and changing as needed to get the page working fully as intended. Once this was completed the accessibility and search engine aspects were improved using semantic HTML as appropriate.

Once completed this was pushed back to GitHub using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` on Git Bash, before publishing at the url below.
